"""
    This module implements a cache that can be used to serve entire requests or cache the output of any function
    (as long it's result can be stored in datastore). The intended use is to wrap functions that can be called from
    the outside (@exposed) with the @enableCache decorator. This will enable the cache provided in this module for that
    function, intercepting all calls to this function and serve a cached response instead of calling the function if
    possible. Authenticated users with "root" access can always bypass this cache by sending the X-Viur-Disable-Cache
    http Header    along with their requests. Entities in this cache will expire if
        - Their TTL is exceeded
        - They're explicitly removed from the cache by calling :meth:`viur.core.cache.flushCache` using their path
        - A Datastore entity that has been accessed using db.Get() from within the cached function has been modified
        - The wrapped function has run a query over a kind in which an entity has been added/edited/deleted

    ..Warning: As this cache is intended to be used with exposed functions, it will not only store the result of the
        wrapped function, but will also store and restore the Content-Type http header. This can cause unexpected
        behaviour if it's used to cache the result of non top-level functions, as calls to these functions now may
        cause this header to be rewritten.
