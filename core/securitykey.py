"""
	This module provides onetime keys.
	There are two types of security keys:
	- If :meth:create is called without arguments, it returns the current session CSRF token. Repeated calls to
		:meth:create will return the same CSRF token (for the same session) until that token has been redeemed.
		This security key will be valid as long the session is active and it's not possible to store data along with
		that key. These are usually used as a CSRF token.
		This has been changed from ViUR2 - where it was possible to create a arbitrary number of security keys per
		session.
	- If :meth:create is called with a duration (and optional keyword-parameters), it will create a security key
		that is *not* bound to the current session, but it's possible to store custom data (the excess keyword
		arguments passed to :meth:create). As these are not bound to the session, each call to :meth:create will yield
		a new token. These are used if it's expected that the token may be redeemed on a different device (eg. when
		sending an email address confirmation email)

	..note: There's a hidden 3rd type of security-key: The sessions static security key. This key is only revealed once
		(during login, as the protected header Sec-X-ViUR-StaticSKey). This can be used instead of the onetime sessions
		security key by sending it back as the same protected http header and setting the skey value to
		"staticSessionKey". This is only intended for non-webbrowser, programmatic access
		(ViUR Admin, import tools etc) where CSRF attacks are not applicable. Therefore that header is prefixed with
		"Sec-" - so it cannot be read or set by javascript.
