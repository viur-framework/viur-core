# UNSTABLE - UNUNSUABLE
This will become the Python3 Port of the ViUR Server.
This will be a mayor update and it's currently _NOT_ usuable.
Use the original Python2 Version at https://github.com/viur-framework/server for now.

# ViUR server

This is the core component of **ViUR**, a free software development framework for the [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com) written in [Python](https://python.org/).

## About

ViUR provides a clear concept for implementing agile data management software. Its underlying database is Googles Cloud Datastore, which is a scalable document database.

The ViUR framework targets to the implementation of information systems, which are integrated, web-based applications or services performing data management and deployment operations of any kind. Therefore, ViUR is explicitly not claimed to be a content management system, although content management can be a part of a ViUR information system.

## Getting started
