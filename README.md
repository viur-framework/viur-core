## About

ViUR is an application development framework for the Google App Engine™.

ViUR was developed to meet the needs and requirements of both designers and developers. It provides a clear concept for the implementation of agile data management software systems. It is written in Python™ and has already attracted a growing community that is constantly supporting and improving ViUR.

## Getting started

To get started with ViUR, check out [viur-base](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base). It comes with a pre-configured and well documented project template to immediately start with.

## Migration

The package contains a service tool `viur-migrate` to migrate existing project sources to the current `viur-core`, by replacing old namings and config variables by their newer counterparts.

After checking the result with `viur-migrate ./deploy/ -d` you can apply the changes with `viur-migrate ./deploy/ -x`.
